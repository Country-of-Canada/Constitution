===============================

Power to admit Newfoundland, etc., into the Union
=================================================

146. It shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the Advice of Her Majesty’s
     Most Honourable Privy Council, on Addresses from the Houses of the Parliament of
     Canada, and from the Houses of the respective Legislatures of the Colonies or
     Provinces of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and British Columbia, to admit
     those Colonies or Provinces, or any of them, into the Union, and on Address from
     the Houses of the Parliament of Canada to admit Rupert’s Land and the North-western
     Territory, or either of them, into the Union, on such Terms and Conditions in
     each Case as are in the Addresses expressed and as the Queen thinks fit to approve,
     subject to the Provisions of this Act; and the Provisions of any Order in Council in
     that Behalf shall have effect as if they had been enacted by the Parliament of the
     United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

As to Representation of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island in Senate
=======================================================================

147. In case of the Admission of Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island, or either
     of them, each shall be entitled to a Representation in the Senate of Canada of
     Four Members, and (notwithstanding anything in this Act) in case of the Admission
     of Newfoundland the normal Number of Senators shall be Seventy-six and their
     maximum Number shall be Eighty-two; but Prince Edward Island when admitted
     shall be deemed to be comprised in the third of the Three Divisions into which
     Canada is, in relation to the Constitution of the Senate, divided by this Act, and accordingly,
     after the Admission of Prince Edward Island, whether Newfoundland is
     admitted or not, the Representation of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in the Senate
     shall, as Vacancies occur, be reduced from Twelve to Ten Members respectively,
     and the Representation of each of those Provinces shall not be increased at any
     Time beyond Ten, except under the Provisions of this Act for the Appointment of
     Three or Six additional Senators under the Direction of the Queen.
